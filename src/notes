Goal: To implement process roll back and checkpoint in a distributed file system with server-client architecture.

For now, implement rollback and checkpoint templates. (Essentially 5.1)

Day 1 (04/28)
How is speculation implemented in the paper? Copy-on-write fork (5.1)
how does speculator check whether the speculation is true or false?

We will be simiulation create_speculation, commit_speculation.



First step: Check how read in a distributed file system functions. Skimmed.

By predicting the speculation, we mean fetching from cache. 

Implementing Cache.


Having trouble adding Cache code to files. 

Resolved template classes usage.

Cache skeleton completed 

One major doubt about cache. What to do in the case of a cache miss. Will now read up about cache miss.

Will also look into jessy's code.
