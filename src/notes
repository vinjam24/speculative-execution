Goal: To implement process roll back and checkpoint in a distributed file system with server-client architecture.

For now, implement rollback and checkpoint templates. (Essentially 5.1)

How is speculation implemented in the paper? Copy-on-write fork (5.1)
how does speculator check whether the speculation is true or false?

We will be simiulation create_speculation, commit_speculation.



First step: Check how read in a distributed file system functions.

By predicting the speculation, we mean fetching from cache.
